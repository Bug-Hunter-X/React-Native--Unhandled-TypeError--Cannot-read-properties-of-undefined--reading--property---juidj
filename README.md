# React Native: Handling Unexpected Token Errors During Asynchronous Data Fetching

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications: encountering a TypeError when attempting to access properties of an object before the data has fully loaded from an asynchronous operation, such as a network request.

## Problem

When fetching data asynchronously (e.g., using `fetch` or `axios`), there's a period where the data is not yet available.  Accessing properties of the object before it's populated results in a `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'property')`.

## Solution

This example addresses the problem by incorporating conditional rendering and null checks to prevent the error.  We use a loading state and only render the UI components that depend on the data after the data has been successfully fetched.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the repository directory in your terminal.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios` to run the application.
